# Investment Calculator

This project contains a simple investment calculator that computes the future value of an investment based on the principal amount, annual interest rate, and number of years.

## Files

- `InvestmentCalculator.py`: Contains the implementation of the investment calculator.
- `seeker.py`: Contains a script that finds words starting with 'A' or 'L' in a given text using threading.
- `labnotgraded.kt`: (Currently empty)

## Usage

To use the investment calculator, run the `InvestmentCalculator.py` script. You will be prompted to enter the principal amount, annual interest rate (as a decimal), and the number of years. The script will then calculate and display the future value of your investment.

```sh
python InvestmentCalculator.py
```
